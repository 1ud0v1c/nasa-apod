# NASA - Astronomy Picture of the Day

Android application which list the last 30 photos of the NASA's API: Astronomy Picture of the Day.


## Design

The main inspiration for the HomeActivity comes from the [Photo Application](https://www.behance.net/gallery/104945199/Photo-Application?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Capplication%20photo) from [Nick Ermakov](https://www.behance.net/extezerofficial).

To be able to provide a great user experience when loading or when an error occurred while fetching the data, I browsed some really great projects, for example :
- [Error Illustrations - Empty States Vol 02](https://www.behance.net/gallery/57693817/Error-Illustrations-Empty-States-Vol-02?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7CAndroid%20empty%20state) from [Nimasha Perera](https://www.behance.net/nimashasperera) 
- [DAY 62-empty state](https://www.behance.net/gallery/53698651/DAY-62-empty-state) from [shangnan zhang](https://www.behance.net/Zhangshangnan)

To find the logo to display the current state of my adapter list, I used the website [undraw](https://undraw.co/).
